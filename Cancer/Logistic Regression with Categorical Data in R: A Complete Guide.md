# Logistic Regression with Categorical Data in R: A Complete Guide

Logistic regression is a popular statistical technique for modeling binary outcomes, such as success/failure or yes/no, as a function of one or more explanatory variables. These variables can be continuous or categorical. In this guide, we’ll explore how to perform logistic regression in R, specifically when working with categorical data.

## What Are Categorical Variables?

Categorical variables are variables with a finite set of possible values. They can be:

- **Nominal Variables**: No inherent order (e.g., gender, color).
- **Ordinal Variables**: Have a natural order (e.g., education level, income group).

Categorical variables may also be:
- **Binary Variables**: Two possible values (e.g., male/female, yes/no).
- **Multi-Level Variables**: More than two values (e.g., country, color).

### Why Do We Need Dummy Variables?

Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between predictors and the log-odds of the outcome. To include categorical variables, we need to convert them into numerical values through **dummy variables**.

For example, if we have a variable for color with three levels: red, green, and blue:
- Create two dummy variables (red and green). 
- Use one level (blue) as the reference category.

This approach allows us to estimate the effect of each level relative to the reference.

## Steps to Perform Logistic Regression in R with Categorical Data

### Step 1: Load the Necessary Libraries and Data
```R
library(ISLR) # For sample data
data(Default) # Load dataset
head(Default) # View top rows
```

### Step 2: Create Dummy Variables
Use the `model.matrix()` function to create dummy variables for categorical predictors.
```R
dummy <- model.matrix(~ default + student, data = Default)
head(dummy)
```

### Step 3: Fit the Logistic Regression Model
The `glm()` function in R fits a generalized linear model. For logistic regression, use the `family = binomial` argument.

#### Syntax:
```R
model <- glm(outcome ~ predictors, family = binomial, data = dataset)
```

#### Example:
```R
model <- glm(default ~ student, family = binomial, data = Default)
summary(model)
```

## Interpreting the Model

The output of `summary(model)` provides:

1. **Coefficients**: Represent the change in log-odds for a one-unit increase in the predictor variable.
   - Intercept: The log-odds when all predictors are zero.
   - Predictor coefficients: Log-odds change for each predictor.
2. **Standard Errors**: Measure the variability of coefficient estimates.
3. **p-Values**: Test the significance of predictors. Small p-values (< 0.05) indicate strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
4. **Model Fit**:
   - **AIC**: Lower values indicate a better trade-off between model complexity and fit.
   - **Deviance**: Measures goodness of fit. Lower values indicate a better fit.

## Predicting Probabilities and Classifications

### Predict Probabilities
Use the `predict()` function with `type = "response"` to predict probabilities.
```R
new_data <- data.frame(student = c("Yes", "No"))
probabilities <- predict(model, newdata = new_data, type = "response")
print(probabilities)
```

### Predict Classifications
Set a threshold (e.g., 0.5) to classify predictions.
```R
predicted_class <- ifelse(probabilities > 0.5, "Yes", "No")
print(predicted_class)
```

## Evaluating Model Performance

### Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix summarizes model predictions:
- **True Positives (TP)**: Correctly classified positives.
- **True Negatives (TN)**: Correctly classified negatives.
- **False Positives (FP)**: Incorrectly classified positives.
- **False Negatives (FN)**: Incorrectly classified negatives.

```R
library(caret)
confusionMatrix(predicted_class, Default$default)
```

### ROC Curve and AUC
The ROC curve evaluates the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity at various thresholds. Use the `pROC` package to plot the ROC curve and calculate AUC (Area Under Curve).

```R
library(pROC)
roc_curve <- roc(response = Default$default, predictor = probabilities)
plot(roc_curve, main = "ROC Curve", print.auc = TRUE)
auc(roc_curve)
```

## Advantages and Limitations of Logistic Regression

### Advantages:
- Simple and interpretable.
- Effective for binary outcomes.
- Provides probabilities for predictions.

### Limitations:
- Assumes linearity between predictors and log-odds.
- Sensitive to multicollinearity.
- May struggle with complex, non-linear relationships.

## Practical Example: Predicting Loan Default
Suppose we want to predict whether a customer defaults on a loan based on whether they are a student. Here's how we can approach this:

1. Fit the logistic regression model:
   ```R
   model <- glm(default ~ student, family = binomial, data = Default)
   ```

2. Predict probabilities for new customers:
   ```R
   new_data <- data.frame(student = c("Yes", "No"))
   predict(model, newdata = new_data, type = "response")
   ```

3. Evaluate model performance:
   ```R
   confusionMatrix(predicted_class, Default$default)
   ```

## Conclusion

Logistic regression is a powerful tool for modeling binary outcomes with both continuous and categorical predictors. In this guide, we explored:

1. **Creating dummy variables** for categorical data.
2. **Fitting logistic regression models** using the `glm()` function.
3. **Interpreting coefficients** and model fit statistics.
4. **Predicting probabilities and classifications**.
5. **Evaluating performance** with confusion matrices and ROC curves.

By mastering these steps, you can confidently apply logistic regression to real-world problems and uncover valuable insights.
