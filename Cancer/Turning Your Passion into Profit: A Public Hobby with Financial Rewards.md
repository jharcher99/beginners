# Turning Your Passion into Profit: A Public Hobby with Financial Rewards

## A Hobby, Not a Hustle
### How I’ve Monetized My Passion for Content Creation

Over the past two weeks, my content creation "side hustle" has seen some small but meaningful successes:

- Daily average of 30 Medium article views.
- Five journals sold on Amazon.
- Eight daily visitors to my website.
- $20 spent on Facebook Ads.
- A logo design purchased for $23.
- Suspension of my Amazon Affiliate account for poor performance.

It dawned on me—this isn’t a side hustle. It’s a public hobby that happens to come with some financial perks.

## Why I’m Excited About My Public Hobby

Despite modest earnings on Medium (just over $20 after nine months), I’m optimistic. Why? Because I’d be doing most of the work anyway. Writing, experimenting, and sharing my knowledge align with what I love to do—like automating my home and exploring creative ideas.

For anyone looking to make their hobby public and tap into the attention economy, here are the tools and strategies I’ve used to build off what I already enjoy doing.

## Tools and Strategies to Monetize Your Hobby

### 1. **Time Investment**
Building a blog, publishing articles, and maintaining a website takes time. However, I’ve found that documenting tasks I’m already doing only adds about 10% more effort. Plus, writing regularly sharpens my communication skills and creates reusable content for future projects.

### 2. **Personal Knowledge Management**
I rely on tools like [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for organizing thoughts and ideas. These tools help me track projects, maintain a consistent color scheme across content, and house reference articles for easy access. If you’re serious about content creation, investing in a robust knowledge management system is invaluable.

### 3. **Website/Blog**
While Medium has been my primary publishing platform, I also run a personal website, [Recursive Automation](https://www.recursiveautomation.com). Having a dedicated site gives me more control over my branding and niche-focused content, like home automation articles. Medium’s active publications list, such as [this resource](https://bettermarketing.pub/43-active-publications-on-medium-in-2020-8a03c1e5b7c9), is also helpful for finding an audience.

## Branding: Spend Money to Save Time

### Fiverr: Outsource Your Creativity
I’m not great at graphic design, but Fiverr has been a lifesaver. I’ve used it for logos, onboarding screens, and other creative tasks. Fiverr offers affordable, fast solutions with great results. Here’s an example of a logo created for my projects:

### Canva: DIY Content Creation
I’ve used Canva to design pages for my self-published journal on Amazon. This drag-and-drop editor simplifies content creation and is perfect for creating professional-looking visuals.

## Publishing a Book or Journal: A Simple Way to Monetize Content

Inspired by articles like [this guide](https://bettermarketing.pub/the-complete-guide-to-uploading-a-marketable-book-on-amazon-kdp-64f70eddfd2), I published a journal on Amazon using existing content. Tools like Canva and Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing program made the process simple and cost-effective.

## Additional Tools for Productivity

- **Todoist**: A to-do app with an API that integrates well with automation tools. I often use it to analyze tasks in Roam Research.
- **Zapier**: Connects apps and automates workflows. For example, I use it to sync Todoist, MailerLite, and other tools.

## Looking Ahead: What’s Next for My Hobby?

While this is just a hobby, I’m exploring ways to scale it. Some ideas include:

- **E-Books**: Create an e-book on home automation using existing blog posts.
- **Online Courses**: Develop a course on setting up home automation systems.
- **Apps**: Build a personal productivity app.
- **Substack Newsletter**: Monetize my findings on personal knowledge management.

Even if it just earns enough for a monthly dinner out, I’ll consider it a success. For now, I’m enjoying the process of sharing what I love with the world.
