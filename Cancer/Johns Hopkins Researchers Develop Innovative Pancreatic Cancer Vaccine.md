# Johns Hopkins Researchers Develop Innovative Pancreatic Cancer Vaccine



**Global Cancer News: 23 June 2014**

## Groundbreaking Advances in Pancreatic Cancer Research

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University Kimmel Cancer Center have developed an innovative vaccine that “reprograms” pancreatic tumor cells to stimulate an immune response against the tumor. 

The vaccine, named **GVAX**, was tested in combination with cyclophosphamide. It employs irradiated tumor cells, allowing it to create structures known as **tertiary lymphoid aggregates** within pancreatic tumors. According to Dr. Lei Zheng, these organized lymphocyte structures, which are unusual in such tumors, indicate substantial reprogramming of the immune environment.

By activating immune cells and suppressing regulatory T-cells (Tregs), these structures can reshape the tumor environment to support cancer-fighting mechanisms. The researchers suggest that this reprogramming approach could also enhance tumor responses to immunotherapy for other cancer types. Moving forward, the team plans to investigate the combination of GVAX and an antibody to PD-1 in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.

## Link Between Indoor Tanning and Skin Cancer

A study conducted by Dartmouth researchers has shed light on the risks of early exposure to ultraviolet radiation from indoor tanning devices. The study, titled *“Early-Onset Basal Cell Carcinoma and Indoor Tanning: A Population-Based Study,”* links such exposure to an increased risk of developing **basal cell carcinoma (BCC)**, the most common form of skin cancer.

The research, conducted by the Children’s Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Center at Dartmouth, analyzed data from 657 participants under the age of 50 with newly diagnosed cases of BCC, alongside 452 controls. A significant number of BCC patients reported indoor tanning compared to the control group, highlighting the dangers of tanning devices, which can emit **10 to 15 times more UV radiation than the midday sun**.

The findings also showed that about 40% of BCC cases were located on the torso, with a stronger association between indoor tanning and tumors in this area. The study underscores the importance of minimizing ultraviolet exposure, aligning with medical recommendations to avoid indoor tanning altogether.

## Genetic Testing Influences Surgical Decisions in Breast Cancer Patients

A separate study, published in the *Journal of Gynecological Oncology*, found that women with breast cancer who tested positive for BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations were more likely to opt for extensive surgical procedures compared to those without such mutations. These genetic mutations significantly increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer in the future.

Out of 302 women included in the study, all of whom met guidelines for genetic testing by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 32 tested positive for the mutations. Among these, 72% altered their surgical plans based on their test results. Key findings include:

- **31% of mutation-positive patients** chose lumpectomies, compared to **59% without mutations**.
- **60% of mutation-positive patients** opted for double mastectomies, compared to **21% without mutations**.
- **12% of mutation-positive patients** chose ovary removal, while none of the mutation-negative patients selected this option.

This study highlights the importance of genetic testing in helping patients make informed decisions about their treatment options.
